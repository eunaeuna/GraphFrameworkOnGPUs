% (future work)
% The graph processing systems can be typically divide into two types; graph analytic systems and graph database systems like Neo4j. We explored GPU based graph frameworks in this paper. Database system on GPU: SQream, Blazegraph, BlazingDB, Brytlyt, Kinetica, MapD, and PG-Strom.
% performance optimization in general, per algorithm, per algorithm
% Dynamic and streaming graph frameworks

% not all algorithm is available at the moment, but work on...

% computation failed -> not appear in the plots

% cuGraph
% the performance of cuGraph in bigger graphs is reasonable like uk2002
% very large graphs beyond uk2005 undirected generates OOM
% PR is better than BFS
% uk2005 undirected in v100 32GB PCI... memory contention... very low...

% Graph..
% uk2005 BFS very fast if set the root as the largest degree node
% root 0 vs. the largest degree node

% no all algorithm are available at the moment.
